==================================================
Generated: 2025-05-24 03:03:55
Test Framework: MSTest (.NET Framework)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
The SendSMSMessage method has been successfully refactored following
best practices and SOLID principles. All core functionality has been
preserved while significantly improving code quality.

TEST EXECUTION RESULTS
----------------------
Total Tests Executed: 29
Passed: 29
Failed: 0
Success Rate: 100,0%
Total Execution Time: 293ms

KEY IMPROVEMENTS
----------------
1. Method Decomposition
   - Original: Single 200+ line method
